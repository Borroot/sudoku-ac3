# Sudoku solver using AC-3
This repository contains an implementation of the AC-3 algorithm for solving sudoku puzzles in Python, as well as a concurrent benchmarker for testing the performance of the solver. The AC-3 algorithm is used in conjunction with a depth-first search approach to solve sudoku puzzles more efficiently. The AC-3 algorithm enforces arc consistency, which allows for the pruning of inconsistent values and the detection of contradictions. This can help speed up the overall solving process and reduce the amount of backtracking required. The implementation and benchmarking results are described in detail in the accompanying [paper](docs/paper.pdf).
